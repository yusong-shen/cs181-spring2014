CS181 / CSCI-E181 Spring 2014
Welcome to Team RLated!

We need three files to function:
	studentAgents.py - our code
	ghostpredict.p	 - pickled ghost classifier
	capsulepredict.p - pickled capsule classifier

These pickles have been built with Scikit-learn 0.14.0. We have not 
been able to test them on Scikit-learn 0.11.0 on any of our Linux or
Mac machines.

Other than that, there are no special dependencies. We use just
numpy and random.

Two additional files in this directory were used for training.
They are not needed for execution:

	capsulelearner.py 
	ghostjuciness.py

One additional file is studentAgent_qlearning.py which our
attempt to model the agent using Q-Learning. See our
writeup for details. It is not necessary for the tournament.

Please contact us for more information. Thanks!!!
